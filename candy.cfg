# Server only supports ws and needs to provide wss through an external web

# Server address allocation is not enabled by default, and the client needs to
# configure a static address through tun.

# [Optional] software-defined wide area network
# IP packets entering 192.168.202.1/32 with the destination address 172.17.0.0/16

# [Optional] Local IPv4 address used for peering connections
