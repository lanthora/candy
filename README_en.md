A virtual private network tool that is easy to deploy and supports peer-to-peer connections. Please refer to [the documentation](https://icandy.one) for more information.

## Features

- Easy to use: Simple configuration to complete the network setup
- Cross-platform compatible: Supports Linux, MacOS and Windows
- Efficient and reliable: The hosts will try to establish peer-to-peer connections first, and use server forwarding if they fail to ensure connection availability.
