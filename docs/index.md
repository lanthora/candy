# Candy

A WebSocket and TUN based VPN for Linux.

## Candy Is A VPN, Not A Proxy

VPN is an abbreviation for "Virtual Private Network", which is a technology that uses public networks (such as the Internet) to build private networks. VPN allows remote users to connect to the internal network of an enterprise or organization through an encrypted tunnel, and access internal resources and services.

Proxy is a common network security tool. Its role is to establish an intermediary service between the user and the target server, thereby hiding the user's real IP address and location information, and enhancing the privacy and security of network access.

## Why A New VPN Was Developed

Widely used VPNs, such as WireGuard and OpenVPN, can be blocked by GFW. Therefore, a VPN that can cross GFW is needed.
